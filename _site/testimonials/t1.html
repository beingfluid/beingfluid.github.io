I have had the pleasure of working with Vishal for nearly 2 years.
In that time he has proved to be a conscientious developer who is engaged in in our complex operations, always willing
to go the extra mile to get results and resolve issues to complete satisfaction.
His calm nature, with patience & professionalism makes working with Vishal very easy.
Vishal has a great ability to manage relationships with both customers and his internal team to obtain the best from any
topic.
He has a good understanding of the ServiceNow environment, with a willingness to help educate others.
I can't honestly evaluate his technical work at a technical level, however I do know the output is always meeting our
needs, works well with improvements implimented as proposed by Vishal to bring added value.
I have no hesitation in recommending Vishal as he is a fine team member to have on board.
