Vishal is a true asset to any team.
- Team Player : check
- Innovative : check
- Dependable : check
Having Vishal on my team, made work so easy. We worked together on ServiceNow, and I never had to worry about any of his
implementations ge made to the platform. He can always be relied on to check all possible use case scenarios.
Brainstorming with Vishal is always a pleasure. He comes ready, having done the background work on the discussion topic.
He listens carefully to everyone's ideas and concerns and can usually suggest multiple ways forward in the meeting
itself. Sometimes he has even made the impossible possible.
Vishal always strives for perfection in his work and helps his team move forward. It's been a real pleasure working with
him. I gave no doubt that whatever he puts his mind to he will achieve!
