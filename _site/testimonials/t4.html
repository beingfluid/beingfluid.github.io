Vishal is someone with an appetite for learning new things...He just can't stop and wait for things to move forward...He
takes things froward, even if others are reluctant to do so...He's reliable, technically apt and is a good team
player...a potent mix of someone who can be a good leader, which he'll be in the due course of time...
